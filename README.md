# recipio

This is a small project to practice React/Redux, and demonstrate fundamental understanding of the component/flux paradigm. It is the beginnings of a recipe management app. Currently you can:

- edit recipes
  - either cancel or commit pending changes
- edit ingredients and steps (double-click a step/ingredient while editing it's recipe)
  - either cancel or commit pending changes
- add and remove ingredients and steps

it is a *work in progress*! :)

**install**: ```npm install```

**run dev server**: ```webpack-dev-server```
